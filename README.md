The purpose of this program is to automatically set up reminders. This program was created for Companies that lease buildings and need to set reminers for their properties (Fire Inspection, Exturminator, ect.)

Upon running this program it will require you to enter in the name of a recipient to recieve the reminders. Than it will ask for an excel file (containing the information for the reminders; see below) which will need to be placed in the same directory as the Driver.py.

The program in its current state will set up reminders for 2 years. Look at the excel formating for more information on how to customize reminders.
